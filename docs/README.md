## Events

### Keynote Address from Dr. Ann Cavoukian

Friday, September 6th, 18:30–19:00

Attend the opening ceremony to hear [Dr. Ann Cavoukian](#ann-cavoukian-keynote-speaker) speak about [Privacy by Design (PbD)](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf) and how youth can incorporate it into their thinking as designers and users of technology. Talk, followed by Q&A from the audience.

### Problem-Product Market Fit – How to build a product for a scalable business

Friday, September 6th, 19:30–20:30. Run by [Ivan Tsarynny](#ivan-tsarynny).

### A hands-on workshop on DNS Security

Saturday, September 7th, 10:00-11:00. Run by [Cuneyt Karul](#cuneyt-karul).

Cuneyt Karul, Ph. D. is the Director of Information Security and Compliance for [BlueCat Networks](https://www.bluecatnetworks.com), a leading Enterprise DNS Software company. Cuneyt Karul will overview the importance of DNS both as an attack vector and from the viewpoint of detection and defense. The workshop will deep dive into how DNS is poisoned, can be used to ex-filtrate confidential data discretely and used to bypass common security controls. Bring your laptops!

### Privacy Enhancing Technologies for the Internet

Saturday, September 7th, 11:15-12:15. Talk from [Ian Goldberg](#ian-goldberg).

The Internet is an essential tool for global communication and collaboration, but some governments dislike the free and open interaction it provides. Find out how Ian Goldberg of the [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP) research group](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo is combating Internet censorship and surveillance with privacy-enhancing technologies.

### How to make an app that is not a privacy horror show

Saturday, September 7th, 12:30-13:30. Run by [Miti Mazmudar](#miti-mazmudar).

Conventional software engineering paradigms do not require developers to engage in determining the privacy-relevant aspects of their design and thus often result in privacy horror shows. The [Privacy by Design (PbD)](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf) paradigm addresses this shortcoming, but in order to _implement_ the principles of PbD, developers need to know relevant tools. This workshop introduces _privacy enhancing technologies (PETS)_ to address various aspects of a privacy-by-design approach, through online walkthroughs of deployed technologies or through examples of prototypes.

### Panel Discussion: Education for ethical design thinking

Saturday, September 7th, 14:00-15:00. Panelists are [Grant Hutchison](#grant-hutchison), [Mariel García Montes](#mariel-garcia-montes), [Paul Heidebrecht](#paul-heidebrecht) and [Scott Campbell](#scott-campbell).

The first step towards privacy by design is a mindset that cares about the social implications of technology. How can schools and universities cultivate this mindset in the next generation of users and innovators? Join an interdisciplinary panel of experts in thinking about this challenge, and get inspired to find answers with your own hacks. Panel discussion followed by Q&A.

### Hands-on introduction to Offensive Cybersecurity

Saturday, September 7th, 15:30-17:30. Run by [Helen Oakley](#helen-oakley), [Roy Firestein](#roy-firestein) and [Vitaly Volovich](#vitaly-volovich).

This is going to be a very quick dive into the world of computer hacking: the bad guys, and the friendly hackers (like us). If you think of the internet as an organism, then we are the immune system; but in today’s fast paced world the criminals have an edge. We will explore the major incidents and trends that shook our world in the last few years, the shadowy entities behind these global attacks, and the widening gap in the supply of professionals and basic cybersecurity literacy that leaves all of us vulnerable. Get a feel for what it's like to be an offensive cybersecurity professional by learning several common hacking techniques, and performing real attacks against a website and a Wifi network.

### The Future of AI in Society – from the perspective of three insiders

Saturday, September 7th, 18:30-19:30. Panelists are [Anson MacKeracher](#anson-mackeracher), [David Hariri](#david-hariri), [Ivan Tsarynny](#ivan-tsarynny) and [Laila Paszti](#laila-paszti).

## Speakers

### Ann Cavoukian: Keynote Speaker

[Website](https://gpsbydesign.org/who-we-are/#meet-team)

Dr. Ann Cavoukian is recognized as one of the world’s leading privacy experts. Dr. Cavoukian served an unprecedented three terms as the Information & Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, networked infrastructure and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. In 2010, International Privacy Regulators unanimously passed a Resolution recognizing Privacy by Design as an International Standard. Since then, PbD has been translated into 40 languages! In 2018, PbD was included in a sweeping new law in the EU: the General Data Protection Regulation.
Dr. Cavoukian is now the Executive Director of the Global Privacy & Security by Design Centre. She is also a Senior Fellow of the Ted Rogers Leadership Centre at Ryerson University, and a Faculty Fellow of the Center for Law, Science & Innovation at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.

Dr. Cavoukian is the author of two books, “The Privacy Payoff: How Successful Businesses Build Customer Trust” with Tyler Hamilton, and “Who Knows: Safeguarding Your Privacy in a Networked World” with Don Tapscott. She has received numerous awards recognizing her leadership in privacy, including being named as one of the _Top 25 Women of Influence in Canada_, named as one of the _Top 10 Women in Data Security and Privacy_, and named as one of the ‘_Power 50_’ by Canadian Business. She was awarded the _Meritorious Service Medal_ by the Governor General of Canada for her outstanding work on creating Privacy by Design and taking it global (May, 2017), named as one of the _50 Most Impactful Smart Cities Leaders_ (November, 2017), named among the _Top Women in Tech_ (December, 2017), was awarded the _Toastmasters Communication and Leadership Award_ (April, 2018), recognized among the _Top 100 Identity Influencers_ (February, 2019), and most recently, she was named among the _Top 18 Global AI Influencers within the AI & Tech Space_ (February, 2019).
